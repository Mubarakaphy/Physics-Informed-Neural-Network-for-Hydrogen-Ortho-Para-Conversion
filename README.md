# -Physics-Informed-Neural-Network-for-Hydrogen-Ortho-Para-Conversion
This project demonstrates how Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can solve coupled heat conduction + ortho/para hydrogen conversion kinetics. It compares the PINN results against a finite-difference (FD) solver and shows how physics-informed ML can model complex thermochemical systems where data are scarce.
